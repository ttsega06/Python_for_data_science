# Visualize_Daily_Treasury_Yield_Curve_Rate


This assignment serves as a comprehensive exercise in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python libraries like pandas and seaborn. Divided into two parts, the assignment covers different skill sets relevant to data science.

In the first part,the Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates, learning to read CSV files into dataframes, plot multiple yield curves on a single graph, and analyze short-term rates through advanced visualizations like PairGrid. They will also create jointplots and heatmaps to understand correlations between different columns.

The second part focuses on the Titanic dataset, data subsetting by selecting specific columns and then proceed to various forms of categorical and multi-dimensional data visualization. The tasks involve generating countplots, violin plots, and boxplots to analyze survival rates, age distributions, and other inter-variable relations.

Overall, the assignment aims to equip students with essential data manipulation and visualization skills, critical for anyone aspiring to excel in the field of data science.
